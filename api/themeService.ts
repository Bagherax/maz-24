/**
 * MAZDADY P2P Theme Service
 *
 * This service simulates the decentralized distribution of UI themes, removing any
 * reliance on external, centralized services like CDNs or GitHub.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### P2P Theme Distribution Flow (Simulation)
 *
 * 1.  **Asset Storage (Admin's Private Cloud):** All theme resources, including
 *     the `theme.json` manifest and image assets (logos, backgrounds), are stored
 *     in the administrator's own private, self-hosted cloud (e.g., MinIO, Nextcloud).
 *     No assets are hosted on external platforms.
 *
 * 2.  **Theme Generation & Signing:** When an authorized admin modifies the theme:
 *     a. The app generates a theme package (`theme.json` + asset references).
 *     b. This package is **digitally signed** with the admin's private key to ensure
 *        authenticity and prevent tampering.
 *
 * 3.  **P2P Publishing (`publishTheme`):** When the admin clicks "Publish," the
 *     signed and encrypted package is broadcast across the network:
 *     a. **Encryption & Chunking:** The package is encrypted and, if large, broken
 *        into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
 *     b. **P2P Broadcast to Trusted Nodes:** The chunks are sent via a custom P2P
 *        protocol to a set of "Trusted Nodes"â€”a selection of reliable peers
 *        (like other admins or internal servers) that act as relays for the update.
 *
 *     **Simulation:** For this app, the "broadcast" is simulated by writing the new
 *     theme to a single, globally-accessible key in `localStorage`.
 *
 * 4.  **Client-Side Sync (`getTheme`):**
 *     a. **P2P Listening:** On startup, each client app listens for theme updates from
 *        the P2P network.
 *     b. **Download & Verification:** When an update is found, the client downloads it
 *        from the nearest Trusted Node and **critically verifies the admin's digital
 *        signature.** An update with an invalid signature is rejected.
 *     c. **Application:** If verified, the theme is reassembled and applied dynamically
 *        without requiring an app restart.
 *
 *     **Simulation:** The client simply reads the theme object from the global
 *     `localStorage` key.
